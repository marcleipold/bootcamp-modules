	- Toast, Inc.

	- Toast was created in 2012 after the founders left Endeca (a software firm which Oracle acquired in 2011)


* Who are the founders of the company?

	- Aman Narang, Jonathan Grimm, Steve Fredette


* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

	- Founders Steve Fredette, Aman Narang, and Jonathan Grimm went into starting Toast with a plan of creating technology aimed at small and midsize businesses (SMBs). After researching which industry to implement their tech, they found out that food had the best potential. Toast’s co-founders also found out that aside from restaurants still using traditional POS systems, restaurateurs weren’t happily using them.


* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?]

	- Toast has raised a total of $902M in funding over 7 rounds. Their latest funding was raised on Feb 14, 2020 from a Series F round. In 2018, the company earned unicorn status as it raised $115 million in a Series D funding round led by T. Rowe Price Associates, increasing the company’s valuation to $1.4 billion. Toast’s valuation increased to $2.7 billion in 2019 as it raised another $250 million in a Series E funding round led by TCV and Tiger Global Management.  According to Toast’s Q2 Earnings, their Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) as of June 30, 2022 was $787 million, up 59% year-over-year.


## Business Activities

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve? 

	- The company provides an end-to-end platform for restaurants to efficiently operate and manage their business. The restaurant industry is one of the largest vertical markets as there are many layers to it. This ranges from POS, websites, marketing, payments, Payroll, Inventory, analytics, Take out, and a lot more. As a result, a lot of restaurants are using multiple products from different companies which makes their operation very complex. This is where Toast comes in and tries to disrupt the market by providing a platform with different products that fulfill all needs.


* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

	- The TAM (total addressable market) for Toast is huge as the restaurant industry is one of the largest vertical markets in the US and globally. According to Toast, the annual sales for the US restaurant industry are $800 billion, representing 3% of GDP. The US TAM is estimated to be 50 billion while the global TAM is estimated to be $110+ billion. This is huge compared to its quarterly ARR (annual recurring revenue) of $0.6 billion. 


* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

	- The company has a few competitors which include Square (SQ), Lightspeed (LSPD), and PAR (PAR). All of these companies offer a POS system but none of them has the same product breadth that Toast has. Square and Lightspeed are not hyper-focused on restaurants as their POS system are made for all types of customer-facing industries including apparel, sports, etc. 


* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like StackShare to find this information.)

	- Toast is at the forefront of the following POS and payment technologies:
		
		- **Contactless payments / QR code / digital wallets** like Google Pay, Venmo and Apple Pay.
		
		- **Artificial Intelligence** - Toast uses artificial intelligence (AI), to automate advanced functions using technologies instead of human labor, they also eliminate any possible human error and provide a consistent experience every time.

		- **Cryptocurrency Processing** - Toast has come out publicly and stated that they were collaborating with crypto companies to enable merchants to accept a wide range of crypto currencies for their purchases. This will help the merchants eliminate most of the processing fees and maximize their revenue.


## Landscape

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

	- Toast is an innovative fintech that offers cloud-based point of sale technology and payment processing services to the restaurant industry.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5–10 years?

	- Cloud-based POS systems are one of the major restaurant technology trends of the past 5-10 years. Self-order kiosks are also an increasingly common piece of restaurant technology, allowing customers to order their food easily at large sporting events or other high volume events. 

	The COVID Pandemic also sped up the adoption rate of online ordering and contactless delivery. This meant that restaurants were going through a complete digital transformation, allowing customers to browse an online menu, place theirorder, pay with their app, track the order as it is being delivered to their doors. The pandemic also improved health standards in restaurants and introduced QR menus, and self ordering from your table, helped reduce overheads for restaurants and helped them survive the pandemic.


* What are the other major companies in this domain?

	- Other popular Restaurant POS companies include Lightspeed Restaurant, SpotOn, and Simphony POS.



## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

	- Currently, Toast is serving 1,300 customers across 230 cities across the globe and has managed to help revive the restaurant industry following the pandemic in 2020. In 2019 Toast was named Forbe’s Fintech 50 and the 2020 Forbes Cloud 100, as well as being recognized as Deloitte Fast 500’s third fastest-growing company. 


* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

	- **ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue)** - recurring revenue from subscriptions calculated annually.

	- **MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)** - recurring revenue from subscriptions calculated monthly.

	- **Revenue** - refers to the money generated from the essential business operations, like service and product sales, interest rates, and other relevant sources of income.


* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

	- The POS industry is one of the most saturated industry in the restaurant and FinTech industry, so even as a unicorn, Toast faces heavy competition from several POS providers like Micros (Oracle), Aloha (NCR), TouchBistro, Upserve, Revel, Square, and Clover. All have received raving reviews in review websites such as Glassdoor and Indeed, and Capterra. 



## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

	- If I could advise Toast, I would recommend they urgently come out with a cryptocurrency payment gateway to allow the patreons of their customers the ability to pay using Bitcoin or other cryptos. 


* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

	- This would restaurants and other merchants accepting crypto help drive traffic to their business and making it easy for customers to pay using novel currency type. The main benefit however is that processing using a crypto gateway instead of a traditional card method will make restaurants less dependent on expensive card networks like Visa and Mastercard and also allowing them to pay close to zero in processing fees.



* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

	- To create a Crypto Payment Gateway, you will need to implement the following technologies:
		
		- **Crypto exchange or an API to an partner exchange**

		- **Back-end portal for merchants**

		- **Plugins for major restaurant industry vendors**

		- **Multiple front-ends including mobile, POS terminals, and web apps**

		- **APIs to connect the back end with all front ends.**


* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

	- These technologies are useful to create a crypto payment gateway because they use code to bring in multiple libraries using API and many plugins or integrations to be compatible with the major restaurant platforms that merchants use to run their business. This plug-and-play approach will enable faster growth and help Toast capture a large percentage of their TAM (Total Addressable Market).
